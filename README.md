# Airmask
This project was born with the strong need to have masks for protection from COVID-19 in this historical period, I developed this model with the collaboration of my dad and I want to make it available to all the people who need it. Feel free to print and modify this model as you wish

##What is the airmask project?
The air mask project was created to help all the people who need filter masks right now.
The project consists of a template that can be printed on a 3D printer.
